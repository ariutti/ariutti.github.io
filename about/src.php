<?php  genheader("About Nicola Ariutti", ""); ?>
<p>This is my personal website, you can find here thoughts, ideas, music and code born during my extra-professional time.</p>


<?php h("This website");?>
<p>This website has been created on the code base by <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net">Fabien Sanglard</a>, a really brilliant person who, in his spare time, devotes himself to research mainly in the field of computer science and retro-engineering of the gaming world, but not only.
<br/>
His website and books have been a great source of inspiration for me.<br/>
You can find a copy of his website code (and also read more about his website techs) <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/ilike/index.html">here</a>, and <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/html/index.html">here</a>.

<p>Thanks Fabien!</p>
